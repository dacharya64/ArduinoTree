# ArduinoTree

## About the Project
CircuiTree was created as a electronic art project for DANM 219 - Electronic Artmaking at UCSC. It is a tree-shaped sculpture made of metal, with lights and a speakers connected by two Arduinos to a heartbeat sensor at the base of the tree. The lights and speakers emit light and sound in time with the viewer's heartbeat.

## Hardware Setup
Needed: 
 *  2 Arduinos 
 *    -1 with Sound Shield [SOUND ARDUINO]
 *    -Other to control lights [LIGHTS ARDUINO]
 *  Heartbeat sensor
 
### Wiring 
Plug in heartbeat sensor on the Sound Arduino, putting red wire into 5V and black wire into ground
  
Put purple wire of heartbeat sensor into breadboard, run 2 leads from that input into A0 of both Arduinos
  
Link Ground of Lights Arduino to breadboard ground, then to ground of Sound Arduino
 
### Audio
Make sure that Sound Shield arduino has SD card with sound files on it, and that output (speaker) is connected to headphone jack
Make sure that volume (round knob on right side of sound shield) is turned up
The headphone jack can be finicky, so you might have to mess with it a bit to get the sound outputting properly
 
### Lights
Light output should be running from the Lights Arduino into the breadboard
Select PWM pins you want to use (any should work) and run leads from those pins to the breadboard
Place the positive end of the LEDs you want to use in line with the wire from the Lights Arduino
Place a resistor between the negative end of the LED and the breadboard ground

### Update Code
Update the code below to include the pins you are using for the lights: 
1) update lightPins[] array with all pin values used
2) Update Blink() calls to include the pins you want to blink. 
First Blink() call will blink all those pins at the same time, then a delay, then the next Blink() call pins will flash

### Uploading Code 
Load "Audio" Arduino code onto Sound Arduino
Load this file ("Main") onto Lights Arduino

Make sure both Arduinos are recieving power.

### User Instructions
Place your finger lightly on the heartbeat sensor and wait 5 seconds
You should now hear audio coming from the speaker, and the LEDs should blink in time with your heartbeat
